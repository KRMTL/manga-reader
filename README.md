# Manga King
Manga King is a responsive web app created by me, Lucas Faria, with the purpose of learning about web development and training my skills. 

# Features
* Register and log in users
* Manga bookmark for each user
* Search manga by name (in development)
* Search manga by genre (in development)
* Read manga and change chapters

# How to use
The app can be used without an account, but the bookmark will be available only for logged users. It is simple, every manga page will have a button to "Add Favorite" or "Remove favorite" to manage the bookmarks. At the bottom of the page every manga will have available a list of chapters, you only need to click and will be redirected to the selected manga page.
